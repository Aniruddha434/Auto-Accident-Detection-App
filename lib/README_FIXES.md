# Runtime Error Fixes

## Issue Description

The application is experiencing two runtime errors when being launched on a device:

1. **Date Parsing Error**:

   ```
   FormatException: Trying to read yyyy from  at 0
   getIsNeedRefreshTokenï¼š FormatException: Trying to read yyyy from  at 0
   ```

2. **Video Controller Initialization Error**:
   ```
   LateInitializationError: Field '_videoController@1652202182' has not been initialized.
   ```

## Root Cause Analysis

Both errors appear to be originating from a different application (`treasure_nft_project`) that has either:

- Been previously installed on the test device
- Had parts of its codebase merged or included in the current project inadvertently
- Is interfering with the current application at runtime

## Fix Recommendations

### For Date Parsing Error

The error suggests that the code is trying to parse an empty date string. The fix would involve:

1. Locate the `getIsNeedRefreshToken` method which likely exists in a file related to authentication or token management
2. Add null-safety checks before trying to parse the date:

```dart
// Original problematic code likely looks like:
DateTime.parse(someStringVariable); // Where someStringVariable is empty

// Fix should verify string is not empty before parsing:
bool getIsNeedRefreshToken(String dateString) {
  if (dateString == null || dateString.trim().isEmpty) {
    return true; // Or false, depending on your application logic
  }

  try {
    final parsedDate = DateTime.parse(dateString);
    // Continue with your logic
    return parsedDate.isBefore(DateTime.now());
  } catch (e) {
    print('Error parsing date: $e');
    return true; // Default safe value
  }
}
```

### For Video Controller Initialization Error

The error indicates a late-initialized variable that is being accessed before it's assigned. Fix options:

1. Locate `home_sub_video_view.dart` which contains a `_videoController` field
2. Ensure the controller is initialized in `initState`:

```dart
late VideoPlayerController _videoController;

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();

  // Initialize with a default value or load actual video
  _videoController = VideoPlayerController.asset('assets/default_video.mp4')
    ..initialize().then((_) {
      setState(() {});
    });
}
```

3. Add null-safety checks when using the controller:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  if (_videoController != null) {
    _videoController.dispose();
  }
  super.dispose();
}
```

## Implementation Notes

Since the actual files causing these errors may not be directly part of this project:

1. These errors might be related to an underlying shared module or plugin
2. If the errors persist, consider checking for naming conflicts between your application and other installed applications
3. Uninstall other applications that might be interfering with your app's runtime

## Additional Debugging Steps

1. Use `flutter clean` and rebuild the application
2. Ensure all plugins are compatible with your Flutter version
3. Check for any shared state or preferences between applications with similar package names
